					which will be a list of the allowable URLs tha can be accessed for this particalar APP
		urlpatterns = [
		path("", views.index, name="index"),
		path("brian", views.brian(), name='brian')
	]
		"" : is the URL that the client has to visit and views.index : is the result that we have to display when client visit URL
